### Overview of Shutdown library
* Shutdown library handles the closing of your app interactively, 
providing a user the chance to revisit his plan of closing the app.
* It can also be used to close just an activity and not necessarily the whole app
* Lightweight
* Has no dependencies
* Survives configuration change
* NO special initialization is required.
* A single line of code does it all!


## Using Shutdown Library in your Android application

Add in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
   repositories {
      ...
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
   }
}
```

Add the dependency
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.emmanuelkehinde:Shutdown:1.1.0'
}
```

Place this in your activity `onBackPressed()` method
```java
Shutdown.now(this); 
```
* This Displays the default message `Press back again to close`.
* A user is expected to press back button again within the next 3 seconds, after which it resets.
* You can also specify the timeout in milliseconds.

Calling it from a fragment
```java
Shutdown.now(getActivity());
```

### To specify a different Toast message
```java
Shutdown.now(this,"Hey! You are about to leave");
```

### To specify a different Timeout (in milliseconds)
```java
Shutdown.now(this,5000);
```

### To specify a different Toast message and a different Timeout (in milliseconds)
```java
Shutdown.now(this,"Hey! You are about to leave",5000);
```
